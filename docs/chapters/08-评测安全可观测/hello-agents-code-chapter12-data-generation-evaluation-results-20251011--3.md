### 详细对比结果


#### 对比 1

- **生成题目**: 25
- **参考题目**: gen_aime_26
- **胜者**: 🤝 Problem A
- **理由**: Upon evaluation, Problem A and Problem B are both solid in terms of mathematical correctness and clarity. However, Problem A exhibits a higher level of problem quality and complexity, which aligns more closely with the AIME standards. Problem A involves an intricate combinatorial setup, requiring the solver to understand properties of a regular polygon and engage in non-trivial counting arguments to find the number of ways to pair vertices, which is a challenging task suitable for AIME. In contrast, Problem B, while correctly formulated and solvable, relies on a straightforward application of the properties of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle. The solution to Problem B is more direct and less complex, as it quickly reduces to finding the radius of the circle, a relatively simple task. Therefore, considering the dimensions of difficulty appropriateness and problem quality, Problem A is the winner due to its higher level of complexity and challenge appropriate for AIME.

#### 对比 2

- **生成题目**: gen_aime_19
- **参考题目**: 10
- **胜者**: 🤝 Tie
- **理由**: Failed to parse response

#### 对比 3

- **生成题目**: 4
- **参考题目**: gen_aime_28
- **胜者**: 🤝 Problem A
- **理由**: Upon evaluating both problems, Problem A is superior in terms of mathematical correctness, clarity, and difficulty appropriateness. Problem A is a combinatorial problem that requires the solver to understand permutations and divisibility rules, which are common themes in AIME-style problems. The problem is clearly stated, and the answer provided is consistent with the problem requirements. In contrast, Problem B has several issues. The solution provided for Problem B incorrectly concludes that the area of one of the smaller triangles is 1, while logically, given the problem statement, the area should be less than 1 due to the division of the area among the smaller triangles. Additionally, the solution lacks clarity, especially in the justification of the final step where it abruptly concludes the area as 1 without proper reasoning, which detracts from its mathematical correctness and clarity. Therefore, Problem A is the better-quality problem.

#### 对比 4

- **生成题目**: gen_aime_7
- **参考题目**: 27
- **胜者**: 🤝 Problem B
- **理由**: Problem B has a clear and unambiguous statement with a correct and straightforward answer. The mathematical correctness of the sequence operations in Problem B is sound and leads to a rational number, where the task is to find the remainder when the sum of the numerator and denominator is divided by 1000. This is a typical AIME-style problem that involves sequences and modular arithmetic, which are common themes in such competitions. Problem A, on the other hand, suffers from a solution that is both unnecessarily complicated and possibly incorrect in its simplification process. The inclusion-exclusion principle is correctly applied, but the final simplification error suggests a lack of clarity or correctness in the solution verification, which affects the overall quality. While both problems have a certain degree of complexity, Problem B's approach to sequences provides a more elegant and appropriate challenge for the AIME context.

#### 对比 5

- **生成题目**: 29
- **参考题目**: gen_aime_6
- **胜者**: 🤝 Problem A
- **理由**: Problem A is mathematically correct and concise. It clearly defines a polynomial function and asks for the sum of specific values of k, which is a well-posed question. The problem is appropriate for AIME standards as it involves understanding polynomial behavior and requires analytical thinking. On the other hand, Problem B has multiple issues. The solution provided in Problem B is incorrect, as it contains errors in calculating the maximum value of f(p). The problem statement in Problem B is somewhat misleading because it suggests maximizing the sum of permutations without a clear strategy, leading to confusion. Additionally, the solution attempts to use permutations without clearly explaining the rationale or strategy behind the selections. While Problem B has potential, the errors in its solution detract from its overall quality. Therefore, Problem A is the winner due to its correctness, clarity, and appropriate difficulty level.

- **参考题目**: 22
- **胜者**: 🤝 Problem B
- **理由**: Both problems are challenging and suitable for the AIME level, but Problem B is the winner based on its higher quality in several evaluation dimensions. Firstly, both problems are mathematically sound, but Problem B is more clearly presented and free from errors or ambiguities in its description. Problem A has some inconsistencies in the solution, particularly in the calculation and explanation of the last three digits of m+n, which is confusing and incorrect as the correct last three digits should simply be the sum 10, not 375. Problem B, on the other hand, is clear and well-structured throughout with a correct answer. Regarding difficulty, both problems are appropriate for AIME, but Problem B offers a more interesting and less straightforward combinatorial challenge, requiring understanding of algorithms and optimization, which adds to its complexity. Overall, Problem B is better designed with a more consistent problem statement and solution, making it the superior problem.

#### 对比 10

- **生成题目**: 4
- **参考题目**: gen_aime_10
- **胜者**: 🤝 Problem B
- **理由**: Both problems present interesting challenges, but Problem B stands out in several key aspects. Firstly, the mathematical correctness of Problem B is clearly demonstrated with a detailed solution that shows a complete and accurate derivation of the problem's parameters. The problem involves well-known geometric principles such as the properties of a triangle inscribed in a circle and the Pythagorean theorem, which are executed correctly and contribute to a well-rounded mathematical experience. In terms of clarity, Problem B is succinct in its presentation of the geometric scenario, making it straightforward to understand the setup without ambiguity. Problem A, while interesting, lacks a complete solution, which makes it difficult to fully evaluate its correctness and reasoning. The difficulty of Problem B is appropriate for an AIME-style question, as it involves multiple steps and requires a solid understanding of geometry and algebra, making it challenging yet solvable. Finally, Problem B is better designed as it naturally engages with mathematical concepts and has a logical progression, whereas Problem A seems more mechanical and lacks a creative spark in problem design.
